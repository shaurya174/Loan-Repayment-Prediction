# Loan-Repayment-Prediction
DECISION TREES AND  RANDOM FOREST
---
This repository focuses on predicting loan default risk using Decision Trees and Random Forest techniques(along with loan_data.csv). It includes a comprehensive Jupyter notebook that covers:

ðŸ“Š Data Exploration: Analyzing and cleaning the dataset for effective feature engineering.

ðŸŒ² Model Building: Implementing Decision Trees and Random Forest for classification.

ðŸ”§ Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.

ðŸ“‰ Visualization: Visual representation of feature importance and decision boundaries.

This project is ideal for learning classification techniques in machine learning, understanding feature importance, and applying tree-based algorithms in real-world financial data.
